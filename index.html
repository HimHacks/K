                <img class="left" src="Images/Chandrayan1.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Chandrayaan-1, launched on October 22, 2008, was India’s first mission to the Moon and a major milestone for the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). The spacecraft was launched from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota aboard a PSLV-XL rocket, making India one of the select few countries to venture into lunar exploration. Although the mission was planned for two years, it ended after 312 days in August 2009, having successfully achieved its core objectives.

                    The primary goals of Chandrayaan-1 were to study the Moon’s surface composition, map its mineralogy, and search for signs of water or ice. Remarkably, the mission confirmed the presence of water molecules on the lunar surface, a groundbreaking discovery that transformed scientific understanding of the Moon’s resources. Additionally, Chandrayaan-1 mapped various minerals on the lunar surface, identifying elements like magnesium, aluminum, and silicon. These findings were made possible by instruments such as the Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3), a collaboration with NASA, which enabled detailed mineral mapping. The mission, completed on a modest budget of around $54 million USD, stands as a significant achievement in India’s space exploration journey.</p>

                <img class="right" src="Images/Saturn V.jpg" alt="">
                <p>The Saturn V rocket, developed by NASA in the 1960s, is widely regarded as one of the most powerful and iconic rockets in history. Designed to support the Apollo lunar missions, Saturn V’s immense size and power allowed it to carry astronauts to the Moon, marking a major milestone in human space exploration. Standing 363 feet tall, it generated an impressive 7.6 million pounds of thrust, capable of carrying a payload of about 140,000 kg to low Earth orbit. Saturn V launched 13 missions from 1967 to 1973, including the historic Apollo 11 mission, which placed the first humans on the Moon in 1969. Each stage of the Saturn V served a specific purpose, with the first stage providing the initial lift, the second accelerating the vehicle into orbit, and the third stage propelling it toward the Moon. The Saturn V’s reliability and power remain unmatched, making it a lasting symbol of the Apollo era and a pinnacle of human engineering.</p>

                <h2>Falcon 9</h2>
                <img class="left" src="Images/Falcon 9.jpeg" alt="">
                <p>Developed by SpaceX, Falcon 9 is a groundbreaking rocket that has redefined modern spaceflight through its emphasis on reusability. First launched in 2010, Falcon 9 was designed for a range of missions, from satellite deployment to delivering cargo and crew to the International Space Station. A unique feature of Falcon 9 is its reusable first stage, which can return to Earth and land either on a drone ship at sea or on land, making it the first orbital-class rocket capable of vertical landing and reuse. This capability has revolutionized the economics of space exploration by significantly lowering launch costs. Falcon 9 has completed hundreds of successful missions, solidifying SpaceX’s place as a leader in commercial spaceflight. In addition to transporting satellites and cargo, it played a crucial role in NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, becoming the first private rocket to carry astronauts into space in 2020. With a payload capacity of up to 22,800 kg to low Earth orbit, Falcon 9 continues to be a reliable and versatile choice for space missions.</p>

                <h2>Space Shuttle</h2>
                <img class="right" src="Images/Space Shyuttle.jpg" alt="">
                <p>NASA’s Space Shuttle program, operational from 1981 to 2011, was a pioneering initiative that introduced the concept of a reusable spacecraft capable of transporting both astronauts and cargo to low Earth orbit. The Space Shuttle was unique in its design, consisting of a winged orbiter attached to two solid rocket boosters and a massive external fuel tank. The Shuttle’s reusability allowed it to conduct 135 missions over three decades, supporting scientific research, satellite deployment, and assembly of the International Space Station. Unlike traditional rockets, the Shuttle orbiter could return to Earth, landing like an airplane, which allowed for repeated missions with the same vehicle. However, the program faced challenges, including the tragic loss of two Shuttles, Challenger in 1986 and Columbia in 2003. Despite these setbacks, the Shuttle remains an iconic part of NASA’s history, known for its versatility and contributions to scientific advancement.</p>

                <img class="left" src="Images/Soyuz.jpg" alt="">
                <p>The Russian Soyuz rocket, first launched in 1966, holds the record as one of the most reliable and longest-operating rockets in history. Originally developed by the Soviet Union, Soyuz has been used to launch a variety of missions, including crewed missions to space stations and satellite deployments. Soyuz was a crucial component of Soviet and later Russian space programs, enabling the Soviet Union to achieve numerous firsts in space exploration, including the launch of the first human, Yuri Gagarin, into orbit. The Soyuz rocket is known for its reliability, completing over 1,700 missions with a high success rate, making it the go-to vehicle for human spaceflight. Following the retirement of the U.S. Space Shuttle in 2011, Soyuz became the primary transport vehicle for astronauts traveling to and from the International Space Station, ensuring continued access to low Earth orbit. Its proven design and dependability make it an enduring symbol of Russian space exploration.</p>

                <img class="right" src="Images/Ariane 5.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Ariane 5, developed by the European Space Agency (ESA) and first launched in 1996, is Europe’s premier heavy-lift rocket, widely used for deploying satellites into geostationary orbit. Built by Arianespace, Ariane 5 has played a central role in European space exploration, launching critical scientific missions, including the deployment of the James Webb Space Telescope in 2021. Standing 171 feet tall, Ariane 5 has a payload capacity of up to 10,865 kg to geostationary transfer orbit, making it ideal for launching large satellites and spacecraft. The rocket’s design prioritizes reliability and precision, with over 100 successful launches since its inception. Ariane 5’s success has solidified Europe’s presence in the global space industry, offering a dependable platform for both commercial and government missions. Its legacy continues as Europe prepares its successor, Ariane 6, aimed at reducing launch costs and enhancing flexibility for future space missions.</p>
